# 💌 Letter Archive (React + Vite)

This is my **letter archive website**, built using **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**.  

It simulates a progression-based reading experience: each pre-loaded letter is revealed in a randomised order and stored in an archive for later viewing. The site features smooth animations, a playful progress tracker, and simple navigation.

Originally designed as a personalised gift, it has since been refactored into a clean, reusable template suitable for interactive storytelling or sequential content delivery.
